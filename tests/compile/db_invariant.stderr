error: lifetime may not live long enough

  = help: consider adding the following bound: `'b: 'a`
  = note: requirement occurs because of the type `Join<'_, ()>`, which makes the generic argument `'_` invariant
  = note: the struct `Join<'t, T>` is invariant over the parameter `'t`
  = help: see <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/subtyping.html> for more information about variance
