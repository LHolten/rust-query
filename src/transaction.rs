/// database will stay compatible for the lifetime of the [Database].
///
/// That is why [Database] also stores the `schema_version`. This allows detecting non-malicious
/// modifications to the schema and gives us the ability to panic when this is detected.
/// Such non-malicious modification of the schema can happen for example if another [Database]
/// instance is created with additional migrations (e.g. by another newer instance of your program).

/// # Sqlite config

/// Making a [TransactionMut] has to wait until all other [TransactionMut]s are finished.
///
/// Sqlite is also configured with [`synchronous=NORMAL`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous). This gives better performance by fsyncing less.
/// The database will not lose transactions due to application crashes, but it might due to system crashes or power loss.
